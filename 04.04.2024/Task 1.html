<h2 style="color: gray">ACT 1</h2>
<h2 style="color: gray">PROLOGUE</h2>
<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<BR>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<BR> 
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<BR> 
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<BR>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<BR>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<BR>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<BR>
    Do with their death bury their parents strife.<BR>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<BR>
    And the continuance of their parents' tage,<BR>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<BR>
    Is now the two hours traffic of our stage;<BR>
    The which if you with patient ears attend,<BR>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
<h2 style="color: gray">SCENE I. Verona. A public place</h2>
<i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
<h2 style="color: gray">SAMPSON</h2>
<p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
<h2 style="color: gray">GREGORY</h2>
<p>No, for then we should be colliers</p>
